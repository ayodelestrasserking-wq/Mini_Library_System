# Mini_library
A simple library management system built in Python using lists, dictionaries, and tuples. This system supports adding, searching, updating, deleting, borrowing, and returning books, as well as managing library members.

## Features

- *Member Management*: Add, update, and delete library members
- *Borrowing System*: Members can borrow up to 3 books at a time
- *Return System*: Members can return borrowed books

## Data Structures Used

- *Books*: Stored in a dictionary where ISBN is the key and book details are the value
- *Members*: Stored as a list of dictionaries containing member information
- *Genres*: Defined as a tuple of valid genres (Fiction, Non-Fiction, Sci-Fi, Mystery, Romance, Biography, History, Science)

## Files

- operations.py - Contains all the core functions and data structures
- demo.py - Demonstration script showing system usage
- tests.py - Unit tests using assert statements
- README.md - This file with instructions## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Running the Demo
To see the system in action, run the demo script:

bash
python demo.py


This will demonstrate all the features including:
- Adding books and members
- Borrowing and returning books
- Searching functionality
- Update and delete operations
- Error handling

### Running the Tests
To run the unit tests:

bash
python tests.py


This will run 7 comprehensive tests covering:
- Adding books successfully
- Preventing duplicate ISBNs
- Borrowing when no copies are available
- Member borrow limits (max 3 books)
- Deleting books with borrowed copies
- Search functionality
- Return book functionality

### Using the System Programmatically
You can import and use the functions in your own code:

python
from operations import *

# Add a book
add_book("978-1234567890", "The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "Fiction", 5)

# Add a member
add_member("M001", "John Doe", "john@example.com")

- update_book(isbn, **kwargs) - Update book details
- delete_book(isbn) - Delete a book (only if no copies are borrowed)

### Member Operations
- add_member(member_id, name, email) - Add a new member
- update_member(member_id, **kwargs) - Update member details
- delete_member(member_id) - Delete a member (only if no books are borrowed)

### Borrowing Operations

- Invalid genres and email formats
- Borrowing limits and availability
- Delete restrictions
- Non-existent books and members

All functions return True on success and False on failure, with descriptive error messages printed to the console.

## Testing

The system includes 7 comprehensive unit tests that verify:
1. Successful book addition
2. Prevention of duplicate ISBNs
3. Borrowing restrictions when no copies available
4. Member borrow limits (max 3 books)
5. Delete restrictions for books with borrowed copies
6. Search functionality for books
7. Return book functionality
